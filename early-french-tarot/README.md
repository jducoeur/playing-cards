These `.pcio` files are for the game _Early French Tarot_, a loose adaptation of how Tarot games might have worked in the late Renaissance.

They are specifically designed to work with [this reconstruction](http://jducoeur.org/game-hist/game-recon-tarot.html), which should be read for a better understanding of the intended rules.

For additional information about Renaissance Tarot games, see [this page on the Period Games Homepage](https://querki.net/u/jducoeur/period-games/#!Tarot).
