### playingcards.io implementation of Common Puff

This is a relatively straightforward Renaissance Tables game, played with a
standard Backgammon set with three dice. [A very brief reconstruction can
be found here](https://querki.net/u/jducoeur/period-games/#!.3y28aw8), but
it is basically a standard Tables game, except that all pieces start out
off the board, and you start out by rolling dice to choose where they enter.
After that, play as normal.
